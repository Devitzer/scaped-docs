# Plugin Initialization

The first step to making a plugin is to **initialize** it! You can initialize it using our **init** command
or by doing it **manually**.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="automatically" label="Automatically">
        Creating your plugin automatically is very easy! Simply run the **following CLI command**.
        ```bash title="Command Terminal"
        scaped init (PluginName) (Directory) --typescape (recommended but optional)
        ```

        We strongly recommend that you learn more about the **__[init](../../commands/commands/init.mdx)__** command.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="manually" label="Manually">
    This is not recommended as there's mostly no advantages to doing this.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What to Do After Initialization

Firstly, we recommend that you check out the **new files** that were created. They do
give some kind of explanation on how to handle your commands.

:::warning
If you did your plugin with TypeScript, what follows will remain the same, except the files will be in the "src" directory.
