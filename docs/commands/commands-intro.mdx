# Commands Introduction

This category will feature **all the commands** that are included with the CLI by **default**! No plugins required.

## Basic Information

All commands must be executed starting with the **"scaped"** keyword followed **by the command** you want to do and any **options** required by the command.
If you try to enter a command **incorrectly**, you will get a descriptive error explaining what you did wrong.

## How The Files Are Formatted

Each file will explain what the command does, the options that are required or not required by the command, and how to use it.
Here is some **important** things to know.

- Arguements are one word arguements used in a command. Example: scaped command arg, arg would be an arguement.
- Options are usually true or false, or several words. Example: scaped command --myOption (just listing that without anything else means that myOption is true) 

Without further ado, let's get started with the **commands!**
